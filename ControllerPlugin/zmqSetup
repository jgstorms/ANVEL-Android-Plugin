There was an issue with setting up zmq in the ANVEL plugin. 

One fix is to include a Preprocessor Definition for _WINSOCKAPI_ under Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Preproccessor. I believe this stops windows.h from including winsock.h which has some conflicts with winsock2.h.

Another fix is to do the following:
Add #include "zmq.hpp" to the very top of ZMQVideo.cpp
Then undefine the values min and max
#undef min 
#undef max 
Then #include <windows.h>
