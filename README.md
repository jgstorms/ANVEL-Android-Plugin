# ANVEL-Android-Plugin
A plugin for ANVEL to send image data from a camera sensor to an Android application and another optional plugin to control the vehicle that the camera is attached to.

To run these plugins you will need to have ZeroMQ installed which can be downloaded here: http://zeromq.org/area:download
You will have to include the libs and include folders from ZeroMQ where it installed. To run, libzmq-v110-mt-4_0_4.dll will also need to be placed in the ANVEL Plugin folder along with the .dll created from building the plugin.
